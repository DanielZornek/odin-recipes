        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This strawberry cake is easy to make from scratch with strawberry puree and strawberry gelatin. 
            This recipe is worth its weight in gold to me as a caterer. 
            I made this cake for a child's birthday party and it was a major hit! 
            Frost with cream cheese frosting or chocolate ganache for a special treat.</p>

        <p>This strawberry cake tastes like it came straight from a bakery â€” 
            but it's surprisingly easy to make at home!</p>
